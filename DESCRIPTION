Description: Photographs taken on film, then developed and then
    scanned are lacking important metadata or if they have, it's from the
    scanning device, not the original camera.
    The APMD package takes NOSSAFLEX structured file names
    and can 1) batch rename corresponding pictures and 2) edit their exif data
    to add information such as focal length, shutter speed, aperture, information
    on the camera and lens such as brand and model and metadata such as location,
    date and time.
    The package also accepts data in JSON format as provided by the `analog`
    and `Frames` apps or in csv as provided by the `Datafilm` app.
    This allows a photographer to take notes on the `analog`, `Frames` or
    `Datafilm` app while shooting pictures, export compatible metadata and use R
    to rename scans and edit their exif metadata with corresponding shot
    information.
