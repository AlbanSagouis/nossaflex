Description: This package relies on a file naming convention for, essentially analog,
    photography. Photographs taken on film, then developed, then scanned are lacking
    important metadata or if they have, it's from the scanning device, not the
    original camera.
    The nossaflex package takes NOSSAFLEX structured file names
    and can 1) batch rename corresponding pictures and 2) edit their exif data
    to add information such as focal length, shutter speed, aperture.
    This allow a photographer to take notes on the `analog` app while shooting
    pictures, export nossaflex compatible file names and use R to rename scans
    and edit their exif metadata with corresponding shot information.
